# ASYNCIFY_REMOVE: functions that make an indirect call which can never reach the JS read.
#
# Asyncify instruments every function that might be on the stack during an unwind, and it treats any
# indirect call as able to reach anywhere. ffmpeg dispatches through function pointers everywhere, so
# bare -s ASYNCIFY instrumented 5744 of 13754 functions, which is 82.6% of the CODE, and every one of
# them pays the state check and the local spill on every call. Only the avio read path can actually
# unwind: fill_buffer -> AVIOContext.read_packet -> Remuxer::avio_read -> val::await().
#
# Each name below is a place that calls a pointer which is never the JS read: av_vlog calls the log
# callback, buffer_replace and ff_refstruct_unref call free callbacks, ff_get_buffer and
# ff_get_encode_buffer call get_buffer2, __pthread_once calls an init routine, __vfprintf_internal
# calls its output sink, ff_tx_init_subtx calls a transform's init. Removing av_vlog alone drops 1077
# functions, because av_log is called from nearly every function in ffmpeg.
#
# Measured: instrumented code share 82.6% -> 66.9%, wasm 13139757 -> 11817023 bytes (-10.1%), and a
# full remux of h264-pcm.mkv 737.7ms -> 634.7ms median over 12 runs (-14.0%, ranges not overlapping).
#
# ASYNCIFY_IGNORE_INDIRECT is NOT usable here, however tempting the numbers are (it reaches 22.0% of
# code and -21.6% size). It means "indirect calls can never be on the stack during an unwind", and in
# this module one always is: the read callback is reached only through AVIOContext.read_packet. Builds
# using it link cleanly, pass no test, and hang rather than fail. No ASYNCIFY_ADD list can fix that.
#
# A wrong name here is silent at runtime but loud at build time: emcc prints "Asyncify removelist
# contained a non-existing function name". Watch for it after any ffmpeg upgrade.

# Two builds of the same source, picked at runtime by the worker on `WebAssembly.Suspending`.
#
# JSPI hands the suspend to the engine, so nothing is instrumented at all: 0 instrumented functions
# against Asyncify's 3832, 9583542 bytes against 11817023, and h264-pcm.mkv remuxes in 556.1ms against
# 634.7ms (and 737.7ms before the remove-list). Chrome and Edge have it from 137, Firefox from 153.
# Safari has none, which is what the Asyncify build stays for.
#
# The JSPI target MUST use -fwasm-exceptions. With -fexceptions the invoke_* trampolines are treated as
# suspending imports and the module traps inside __wasm_call_ctors before any of our code runs: measured
# as 36 of 36 tests failing. Native wasm EH emits no invoke_* at all, which is why it works.
